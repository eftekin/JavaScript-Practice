<h1>JavaScript-Practice</h1>

<p>This repository is created for practicing JavaScript as I begin my learning journey. It contains simple code snippets and basic projects that I have worked on while exploring JavaScript concepts.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As I progressed through my JavaScript learning journey on Codecademy, I found it helpful to have a dedicated repository to store and organize my practice code. This repository serves as a portfolio of my JavaScript skills and showcases the different concepts and techniques I have learned.</p>
